    <h1>Love</h1>
    <h2>by John Clare</h2>
    <script src="js/app.js"></script>
    <p>Love, though it is not chill and cold,<br>
        But burning like eternal fire,<br>
        Is yet not of approaches bold,<br>
        Which gay dramatic tastes admire.</p>
        <p>Oh timid love, more fond than free,<br>
        In daring song is ill pourtrayed,<br>
        Where, as in war, the devotee<br>
        By valour wins each captive maid;--</p>
        <p>Where hearts are prest to hearts in glee,<br>
        As they could tell each other's mind;<br>
        Where ruby lips are kissed as free,<br>
        As flowers are by the summer wind.</p>
        <p>No! gentle love, that timid dream,<br>
        With hopes and fears at foil and play,<br>
        Works like a skiff against the stream,<br>
        And thinking most finds least to say.</p>
        <p>It lives in blushes and in sighs,<br>
        In hopes for which no words are found;<br>
        Thoughts dare not speak but in the eyes,<br>
        The tongue is left without a sound.</p>
        <p>The pert and forward things that dare<br>x
        Their talk in every maiden's ear,<br>
        Feel no more than their shadows there--<br>
        Mere things of form, with nought of fear.</p>
        <p>True passion, that so burns to plead,<br>
        Is timid as the dove's disguise;<br>
        Tis for the murder-aiming gleed<br>
        To dart at every thing that flies.</p>
        <p>True love, it is no daring bird,<br>
        But like the little timid wren,<br>
        That in the new-leaved thorns of spring<br>
        Shrinks farther from the sight of men.</p>
        <p>The idol of his musing mind,<br>
        The worship of his lonely hour,<br>
        Love woos her in the summer wind,<br>
        And tells her name to every flower;<br>
        But in her sight, no open word<br>
        Escapes, his fondness to declare;<br>
        The sighs by beauty's magic stirred<br>
        Are all that speak his passion there.</p>
